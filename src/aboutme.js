            <p>
                My name is T. Mohan Siva. I am studying in the second year at SRKR College of Engineering and Technology in the CSD branch. I completed my diploma graduation at DNR College of Engineering and Technology in Bhimavaram. My short-term goal is to secure a job in a reputed company, and my long-term goal is to become a software engineer. My hobbies include watching anime and creating new designs in frontend development. That's all about me!
